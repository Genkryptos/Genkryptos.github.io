# Mayank Sahu — GitHub Pages

This is a **single-page** portfolio site (no build step).

## Publish on GitHub Pages (recommended)
1. Create a repo named **`<your-username>.github.io`** (example: `Genkryptos.github.io`).
2. Upload these files to the repo (or `git push`).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/(root)**
4. Save. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.

> If you deploy from a folder (like `/docs`), put the `.nojekyll` file in the published folder.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` for text/sections.
- Replace `assets/Mayank_Sahu_Resume.pdf` with the latest resume.
